🏠 # A-Smart-System-for-Personalized-Interior-Design-AR-Try-On

🚀 **Ongoing Project (2025)** | Woxsen University

## 📌 Introduction

Interior design often feels overwhelming — **90% of users struggle to visualize furniture in their rooms before purchasing**, leading to wrong choices and dissatisfaction.
This project builds a **smart interior design system** that combines **Computer Vision (CV), Generative AI, and Augmented Reality (AR)** to help users:

* Detect furniture & room layouts.
* Get **personalized design recommendations**.
* Use an **AR Try-On feature** to virtually place furniture in real rooms.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

* Users cannot easily imagine how furniture will look or fit in their rooms.
* No **personalized recommendation system** adapts designs to actual room conditions.
* Lack of a proper **“try-before-you-buy” feature** in interior design/e-commerce.

---

## ✅ Objectives

1. Analyze room images using **CV models** (ResNet & YOLOv8).
2. Suggest **personalized furniture & design styles**.
3. Provide an **interactive AR Try-On feature** using WebXR.
4. Enable **feedback loops** to refine recommendations.

---

## 🧩 Methodology

1. Data Preparation – Collect room images, preprocess (resize, augment, normalize), and build ETL pipeline with annotations.
2. Computer Vision Models – Train ResNet for room classification and YOLOv8 for furniture detection.
3. Personalized Recommendations – Suggest styles, furniture, and optimized layouts.
4. AR Try-On – Allow users to virtually place furniture and see 3D/AR visualization using Web XR(Web Extended Reality-API).
5. Feedback & Improvement – Collect user feedback and refine future recommendations.
